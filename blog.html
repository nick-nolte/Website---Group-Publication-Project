      <h2>How The Metaverse Can Benefit The World</h2>
      <img src="images/AngleoProfile_Web.png" style="height:50px;"<h5> Angelo McCaskle December 5, 2022</h5>

      <p>The metaverse is a virtual world that uses virtual reality technology and allows humans to interact as avatars. The metaverse was essentially invented by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel, Snow Crash. Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg the metaverse is coming to life sooner than we think. Many believe that the metaverse is the next level of the internet. After the pandemic, people saw the need to have advanced technology for communication reasons. The metaverse provides users with a real experience of meeting someone and interacting with them. In this 3-D universe, it can address several issues like; remote work, making the gaming world more exciting, virtual tour experiences, and creating virtual businesses. Meeting new people from the comfort of your home could be really cool because you can choose to meet them or keep them as online friends. This gives people new ways to find friends and provides people with expanding their network. When covid shut the world down many went to zoom for work and school. However, in the metaverse you can host an actual class or meeting sitting down at a table full of your colleagues/peers. The avatars in the metaverse react like actual humans and it is really interesting as to how this is done. Gamers and non gamers can now enjoy a full virtual experience when playing video games. This will change the user's experience and will even get new gaming developers involved to bring more games to the platform. Imagine going on your laptop and when you open Google you search for a business or a home and there is a virtual tour option. Currently, you can only see virtual tours on a computer, but with the metaverse you can have a new perspective. By simply putting on the VR goggles you can explore any business applicable that has virtual tours. Having this fully immersive view can change your perspective and give you an accurate look of a house, school, or business. One of the most important ways that the metaverse will change and benefit the world is by creating virtual businesses. I believe the metaverse gives everyone a chance to become a digital entrepreneur. This could be especially of value for E-commerce owners, because they will have the chance to interact with merchants and persuade them “ in person” rather than online. With digital currency becoming bigger by the minute, metaverse will be key in trading of digital assets. The metaverse has many cool features, but there are still some things to be perfected before the full launch of the metaverse.</p>

			<h2>Metaverse</h2>

			<p>Imagine a virtual world where people live, work, shop, learn and interact with each other all from the comfort of their couches in the physical world. In this environment, digital facsimiles or avatars representing users, move around freely from one experience to another while maintaining their virtual identity and digital goods. This immersive digital reality platform is called the metaverse. It combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, non-fungible tokens, and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually. As futuristic as the metaverse may seem, we are making advancements in the technologies that are the driving forces needed to move forward with the metaverse. As the skill sets and knowledge in the needed technology continues to mature and grow, I have no doubt that the metaverse will be reality.
				The metaverse will change the way content creators work and utilize powerful tools to create interactive and immersive environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) no code tools will help creators design and distribute augmented reality effects. These tools will enable creators to translate high-level visions into consumer ready content. AI-powered tools will assist with video editing, animation, and music composition. Content creators will be able to make even the craziest ideas become reality. Creativity will have no bounds!
				The metaverse will give content creators an opportunity to reach new markets, audiences, and just connect with customers at a new level. Blockchain technology will open the door to incentivize content creators to become independent of centralized platforms. Users can stake their digital assets on specific creators encouraging them to release more content of a certain type. Other users may pay to access special content or reward their creator with donations. As a result of this, content creators will have the opportunity to earn more monies without having to share profits with centralized hosting platforms.
	Lessons learned in the past will aid in taking a more active approach in crafting the metaverse. Challenges such as controlling the privacy of users and businesses and authenticating the identity of individuals who are moving around the virtual world disguised as digital avatars need to be considered. Users will need to be protected from unscrupulous persons or even bots that will be able to explore the metaverse under the disguise of an individual, and scam other users or damage the reputation of business brands. We can learn from our previous mistakes and built the metaverse responsibly by taking the proactive approach early in the process.
	The present platforms and privacy protocols utilized by Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet cannot be fully trusted. Each company’s platform has advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered. It is evident that all the companies need to be more transparent and publicly discuss and disclose what data they are collecting, how data is being used, tracked, and sold. But in the end, it is up to the user to determine which company platform will best meet his/her needs.</p>

			<p>We will look back at technology in our life and realize how much of a change was made. Technology is always growing and always changing. With time it is only going to get more intense. I know that in the future I will look back and think that the most technologically advanced thing now is going to be the least advance because of how much progression there is with technology. I do agree that it does seem like Sci-Fi but it is whats going on in digital media. An immersive environment will dramatically change the way content is created. Content will grow and people will be looking at content as the number one thing. Content will be taken more seriously. I think the mistake we can avoid is taking time with getting the technological advancements to work properly before it's put out into the world. It needs to work in a way that people will not get frustrated. Another mistake we can avoid is making sure people have the proper privacy for themselves. Privacy can go a long way and that will be important in this type of immersive environment. Another mistake that can be avoided with new technology advancement would be to make sure you are doing the right research when using these technologies. I think it can be easy to get frustrated with things like this but you have to have patience with it. Advancements can be intimidating. I personally don't think you can trust any company but at the same time, it's where all our technologies come from. I think privacy wise we cannot trust companies like Facebook and Apple because they really do have all of our information. At the same time, these are the companies that are the social norm and making the most technological advancements. Watching the video of Mark talking about the metro universe was insane. It does not feel real that this can happen. It is stuff you see in the movies that seem so fake but it will happen in the next ten years. It will be so interesting to see how these improvements will be made and how they will improve even further. I feel like it's so hard to visualize it. Digital media will definitely take over and creators will probably be making lots of money. Even watching the video of Mark it seems so fake and advanced. It makes me question if companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google will even still be around in the next ten years or if new way more advanced companies will take over. These companies have already been around for a while and have made so many improvements so I wonder if they will go down or go up. It makes me wonder what the problems these content creators will run into with this immersive environment that Mark was talking about and how they would be solved. Technology advancements can seem sometimes scary and intimidating. It will be exciting to see what is to come in the next couple of years. </p>
